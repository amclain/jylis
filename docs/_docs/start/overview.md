# Overview

If you're here, you're likely interested in trying Jylis for yourself. There are a few good ways do that:

- For 64-bit Linux machines, you can [download a static binary](../download).

- For other plaforms, the easiest way is to [use the docker image](../docker).

- If you want to hack in your own changes, you may need to [build from source](../compile).

    Jylis is still unfinished software, and hasn't yet been formally released. Similarly, this guide is also unfinished. The intent is to accurately document the features that currently exist, though at times documentation for some features may be either out of date or not yet written.
