# Download (for Linux)

If you intend to run Jylis in a 64-bit Linux environment, you can download it as a static binary with no dependencies.

Jylis is in pre-release, so there are no actual releases available to download, but you can download the latest nightly build of the static binary from [the releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/jemc/jylis/releases). Find the "Nightly" release there and download the `jylis` binary from the Assets list.

Note that you'll need to mark the downloaded file as executable before you can run it. You can do this with a command like `chmod a+x jylis`.
